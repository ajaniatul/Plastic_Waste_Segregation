ðŸ˜ŠHello, This is my project on plastic waste segregation based on recyclability. 
- I have taken 69 image datasets of various plastic wastes and labelled them as Recyclable and Non-Recyclable
- The datasets are trained on traditional CNN and the model is used for Real-time classification of plastic wastes

- âœ…Result: The model showed an accuracy of 99% in classifying the plastic wastes
